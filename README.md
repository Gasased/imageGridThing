# imageGridThing

> A simple, sleek desktop app designed to help you browse and compare image samples generated by [Ostris's AI-Toolkit](https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit).

It's a smile app to help display `ai-toolkit`'s samples. No more clicking through files—see all your generated images in a structured grid, organized by training steps, and inspect them with powerful interactive controls.
